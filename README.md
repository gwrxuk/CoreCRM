# CoreCRM - High-Performance Data Processing Platform

A production-grade data processing platform built in Rust, designed to handle high-throughput data ingestion, transformation, and analysis from various marketing and sales data sources.

## Features

- High-throughput data ingestion (millions of records per second)
- Real-time data transformation and processing
- Multiple data source integrations (CRM, Analytics, Marketing Tools)
- RESTful API for data access and management
- Efficient data storage and retrieval
- Robust error handling and monitoring
- Scalable architecture

## Architecture

The platform consists of several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Handles incoming data from various sources
   - Implements rate limiting and backpressure
   - Validates and normalizes incoming data

2. **Processing Engine**
   - Transforms and enriches data
   - Implements business logic
   - Handles data aggregation

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Efficient data storage and retrieval
   - Implements caching strategies
   - Handles data persistence

4. **API Layer**
   - RESTful endpoints for data access
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **Web Framework**: Axum
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Containerization**: Docker
